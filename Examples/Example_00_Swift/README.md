## The Playground

Playground is a new tool introduced by Apple to write code and execute it without creating a new project nor build so the playground has a building loop which executes all the code we write in real time.

To create a new playground open xcode and select **Get started with a playground**

The Playground IDE is very simple. You have the left side to write code, right side to see the results and on the bottom you can see the console that can be shown/hidden.

## Swift language

On the attached example you can see how to use the basic sintax and the main types to introduce you to Swift.
